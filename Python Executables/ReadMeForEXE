Not sure if these files work yet. They have not been tested on a fresh machine, they do work on the machine I used to build the code however...

Look at this if it doesn't work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39563851/how-to-include-chromedriver-with-pyinstaller#comment69226954_39648291

Used Pyinstaller to create them.
